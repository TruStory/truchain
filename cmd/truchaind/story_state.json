I pick two events: 1) Block 501726 had no transaction outputs (except a 0-value commitment), losing the entire 12.5 BTC subsidy. 2) Block 526591 didn’t claim half of the block reward, losing 6.25 BTC. Again, using blockchain.com, we can see that Block 501726 claimed 0 BTC. Block 526591 claimed 6.25 BTC, which is half of the next block’s reward of 12.5 BTC. These prove that in addition to the Block 124724 event, there are at least two more events where Bitcoin’s mined supply was reduced. ",
